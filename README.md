# FloodSens
A Mobile App that reads data from a network of sensors scattered in urban areas, to alert on floods or water leaks. This IoT application uses **M2X client** from AT&T to aggregate captured data, and the hardware operation is assured by a brace of Texas Instruments' **LaunchPad** and their **Wi-Fi CC3200** extension board.
